## Business model

At the core of our business model for PocketCampus is the understanding that our primary customer is the EPFL administration, rather than the students themselves. Our value proposition to the administration hinges on streamlining and centralizing access to several of EPFL's most viewed content and services. This consolidation not only enhances the campus experience for students and staff but also significantly improves administrative efficiency by providing a unified platform for information dissemination and student engagement.

The nature of PocketCampus as a comprehensive campus app requires a gradual and iterative development process, aligning with the evolving needs and use cases of the EPFL community. We believe that it could take several months to fully understand and integrate the diverse needs of such a dynamic user base into the app. This period is critical for identifying key functionalities, refining existing features, and ensuring the app's alignment with the varied aspects of campus life.

Recognizing this developmental trajectory, **we plan to propose a one-year lock-in contract with EPFL**. This duration is strategically chosen to allow sufficient time for the app to mature and demonstrate its full potential. Unlike applications with immediate mass appeal, such as games that can go viral overnight, PocketCampus is expected to gain traction and user loyalty progressively. Over the course of a year, we will be able to collaboratively work with the administration and users to tailor the app, ensuring it meets and exceeds the expectations of the EPFL community. This approach not only ensures a well-rounded and effective product but also fosters a strong, ongoing partnership with EPFL.

The one-year lock-in period also provides a stable financial and operational framework for us to invest in the necessary resources, development, and support required to make PocketCampus a success. It offers a predictable revenue stream and a clear timeline for both development and return on investment, benefiting both PocketCampus and EPFL. Additionally, to incentivize EPFL to promote our app, we plan to offer attractive rates if the contract is made based on the total EPFL population instead of active users. This is aimed at creating an operational synergy that is beneficial to both EPFL and PocketCampus in the long run.
