# Analysis of the Situation

Currently, the competing products for outdoor activities on the market are Strava, OutdoorActive and Alltrails. While these apps are popular, Lasta aims to carve out a niche by offering a unique combination of real-time updates, multilingual support, and robust community features tailored specifically for the Swiss outdoor enthusiast, addressing gaps in personalized recommendations and offline accessibility that current competitors may not fully cover. The goal is to be more specific and well-fit for swiss needs so that they use Lasta instead of the competitors.
