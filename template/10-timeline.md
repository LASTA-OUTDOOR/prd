# Timeline/Resource Planning

## Execution Roadmap 

The realisation of the MVP described beforehand will be done over the course of 14 weeks/sprints (using the SCRUM model), divided into 6 Milestones, each focused on certains core features of the app. This will be done by a team of 7 people, each working around 15 hours per week, with relatively fluid roles, i.e. no defined front/back end engineers. In each sprint, testing is implied (for around 2-4 hours per sprint per person) and will not be included in the following tables.


### Milestone 1

Set up and start of core front/backend features and development tools\
-Set up FIGMA for future front-end development\
-Start basic database functionalities using Firebase\
-Set up Google authentication\
-Set up the base for API calls using OpenStreetMap to get outdoor activities\
-Set up a map screen using Google Maps API\
-Set up a profile screen\
-Set up navigation between screens\

-Add ratings to activities\


| Sprint/Week Number | Objective | Outcomes |
---------------------|------------|-------------------------|
| Week 4                 | Start of Community tab and Discover screen  | Create community screen, functions to add friends and ability to see friend's profiles. Create discover screen and filtering options for it |
| Week 5                 | End of Community tab, UX improvements and More Info screen |  Create messaging system, translate the app, a and other smaller UI changes |
| Week 6                 | Weather and Settings tab  |  Create weather tab and add basic fucntionalities to see weather for the next day. Create a settings tab to modify preferences and allow user to log out of their account|

### Milestone 3

 Notification system, offline mode, start of tracking for activities\

-Add notification for friend request and messages\
-Create android room database for the offline mode\
-Add the ability to dowload activites\
-Store users' profiles offline\
-Add a step counter\
-Add the ability to start tracking for activities using the user's position\

| Sprint/Week Number | Objective| Outcomes |
---------------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| Week 7                 | Notification system and start of offline mode |  Add notification for friend request and messages. Set up android Room database     |
| Week 8                 |  End of offline mode and start of tracking | Allow users to save activites and their profile. Add a step counter and tracking using position |


### Milestone 4

Finish tracking, delete account, polish UI and debugging\
-Add pictures for activities\
-Add information about distance, speed and altitude to the tracking\
-Debug the app in general\
-Fix/polish UI\

| Sprint/Week Number| Objective | Outcomes |
--------------------|------------|--------------------------|
| Week 9                  |  End of tracking and add pictures to activities  |  Add information about distance, speed and altitude. |
| Week 10                 |  Delete account and Debugging/UI fixes  |   allow users to delete their account and all information stored about them  |

### Milestone 5

Initial rollout to alpha testers\
-Allow a set number of alpha testers to access the app to report any issues\
-Fix the bugs/UX problem they report\

| Sprint/Week Number | Objective | Outcomes |
---------------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Week 11                  | Alpha testing  |   |
| Week 12                 |  Fix issues shown by alpha testers  |     |

### Milestone 6

Rollout of version 1.0 of the app to the App store\
-Publish the app\
-Observe any issues not previously found or caused by the higher number of users\
-Keep up with performance statitics\

| Sprint/Week Number | Objective | Outcomes |
|-------------------|-----------|---------|
| Week 13/14                 | Rollout and observation  |   |

## Development Resources

The main cost in the development process will be the salary of 7 developers to create the base of the app. Once the app is mostly finished, i.e. around the end of Milestone 4, only 3-4 full time developers will be needed to work with alpha testers and actually publish the app and then maintain it. Alpha testers will also need to be paid, but much less than the actual deveopers. Access to Firebase/ paid APIs will probably also infer some relatively low costs. The rest of costs will be developed in the monetization part thtat follows.
