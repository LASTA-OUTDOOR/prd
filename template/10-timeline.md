# Timeline/Resource Planning

## Execution Roadmap 

The realisation of the MVP described beforehand will be done over the course of 14 weeks/sprints (using the SCRUM model), divided into 6 Milestones, each focused on certains core features of the app. This will be done by a team of 7 people, each working around 15 hours per week, with relatively fluid roles, i.e. no defined front/back end engineers. In each sprint, testing is implied (for around 2-4 hours per sprint per person) and will not be included in the following tables.


#### Milestone 1

Set up and start of core front/backend features and development tools.
-Set up FIGMA for future front-end development
-Start basic database functionalities using Firebase
-Set up Google authentication
-Set up the base for API calls using OpenStreetMap to get outdoor activities
-Set up a map screen using Google Maps API
-Set up a profile screen
-Set up navigation between screens
