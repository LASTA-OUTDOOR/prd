# The Value Proposition

*Describe the value proposition and argue that it is:*

*1. Easy to communicate*
Sport is a big part of european culture and its assets are easily described. Moreover, this app is inherently social and users will encourage their friends to use it too.

*2. Defensible*
Lasta offers a wide range of features and serves as a multi-tool sport centered app. Surely every functionality can be found in a competitor but Lasta has them all contained in one app. Since it is centered on Switzerland, Lasta is also more precise for swiss people.

*3. Relevant*
The swiss population is one of the most sportiest in the world. This app therefore has a lot of reach and can be able to answer the needs of swiss sport communities.
