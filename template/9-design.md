# Design and Implementation

## Frontend

#### Implementation Framework
The app will be developed in Kotlin, optimized for Android, and will utilize the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. This approach will ensure a structured and efficient management of the app's UI and business logic.

#### Dynamic UI Rendering Strategy
The data layer will fetch machine-readable UI descriptions that provide detailed information about the required components for each feature. The ViewModel will interpret these UI descriptions and manage the state and logic for each feature, ensuring high responsiveness to any data changes.

Additionally, loading indicators or messages will be shown when data is being synced. Robust error handling will inform users of any issues with data retrieval or sync, and options to retry failed operations will be provided.

#### Component Management and Modular Approach
The UI layer will be composed of various components managed by the ViewModel. Each feature, such as Authentication, Map, Discover, Profile, Preferences, Social, and Favorites, will have corresponding ViewModels and components to handle specific tasks. This modular approach will ensure a clean separation of concerns, with the UI layer focusing solely on rendering and user interactions.

For example, the DiscoveryViewModel and WeatherViewModel will work together to fetch the user's position, nearby activities, and weather reports. The ProfileViewModel will manage user activities, preferences, and other profile-related data.

#### Security
The app will follow secure key management practices, using trusted hardware or secure storage solutions like the Android Keystore to protect encryption keys. Rate limiting and throttling will be implemented to prevent abuse and mitigate DoS attacks.

Additionally, the app will encrypt user information. Sensitive data storage will be minimized, and proper data retention policies will be enforced.

Finally, the app will regularly update and patch security vulnerabilities, with a secure update mechanism to prevent tampering.

#### Caching Strategies
To optimize data retrieval and minimize unnecessary network requests, the frontend will implement local storage mechanisms to cache user preferences and activity data.

Additionally, the frontend will incorporate logic to check the cache first before making network requests, reducing redundant fetches and minimizing network usage. Appropriate expiration policies will be set for cached data to ensure it is refreshed periodically.

#### Supporting Offline Mode
The app will provide users with options to download specific activities for offline access. This will be achieved by saving the required data locally on the device. A UI component, such as a button or a toggle, will allow users to choose which data they want to download for offline use.

Furthermore, to ensure smooth functionality in offline mode, the app will retrieve data from the local cache. Background synchronization logic will be implemented to update and sync data with the server when the user comes back online.

Finally, the UI will adjust to indicate when the app is in offline mode, such as displaying an "Offline" banner or disabling certain features that require an active internet connection.

#### Security Considerations

## Backend

*Decompose the MVP into functional blocks.*

## Data Model

*What data are you collecting / managing?*

*How is it organised?*

*Where is it stored?*

*How is it shared/copied/cached?*

## Security Considerations

## Infrastructure and Deployment

*How is the application developed, tested and deployed?*

*Any special infrastructure requirements.*
