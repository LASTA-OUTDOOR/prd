# History

Key features of the V1 PoC included Google authentication for a seamless and secure login experience. Users could easily find activities around them, either displayed on an interactive map or in a list format, based on their current location or a selected place. This feature ensured that users could discover new hiking, climbing, biking, and trail running spots effortlessly.

To enhance user experience, the app allowed users to save activities and their preferences, making it simple to revisit favorite spots or receive tailored recommendations. Recognizing the diversity of language in Switzerland, Lasta was made available in three languages, ensuring accessibility for a wider audience. Additionally, users could filter through activities to find exactly what they were looking for, whether it was an easy hiking trail or a challenging climbing route.

The V1 PoC also included a step counter, allowing users to track their physical activity and stay motivated. Users could save information about the activities they had completed, providing a personal log of their outdoor adventures. To cater to the needs of users in areas with limited connectivity, Lasta enabled the downloading of activities for offline access.

Social features were also a significant part of the PoC. Users could add friends within the app and send messages, fostering a sense of community and making it easier to plan group activities.

From the V1 PoC, we learned that the core functionalities were well designed: it it easy to find and save activities. The multilingual support is crucial, as it broadens the app's appeal. However, we also identified areas that are needing improvement: more personalized recommendations and advanced filtering options for example.

To transition from the PoC to a Minimum Viable Product, several key enhancements are necessary. First, we need to refine the recommendation engine to provide more personalized and accurate suggestions based on user preferences and activity history. Improving the filtering capabilities will also be crucial, allowing users to narrow down activities more effectively.

The social features need to be expanded to include more interactive elements, such as activity sharing, group event planning, and integration with broader social media platforms. 
By addressing these areas, we can bridge the gap from a promising PoC to a robust and widely-adopted MVP, ultimately fulfilling Lastaâ€™s mission to revolutionize the outdoor sports community in Switzerland.
