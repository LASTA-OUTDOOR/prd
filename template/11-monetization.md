## Revenue Streams

Our app will generate revenue through three primary channels: targeted advertisements, optional subscription fees and commissions on guided activities.

The targeted advertisement system will display relevant ads based on the type of activities users are interested in. This ensures that users receive ads that are beneficial and related to their sporting activities, enhancing their overall experience while providing a significant revenue stream for the app. For example, users looking for bicycle trails will see ads for bicycle tires, maintenance services, cycling gear, and local bike shops on the details page of an activiy. Similarly, users interested in hiking events will see ads for hiking shoes, fitness trackers, sports apparel, and local alpin / hike clubs. Additionally, the ads will be geo-targeted to show local services and products, enhancing relevance and increasing the likelihood of user engagement. Performance-based ads will also be incorporated, relating to the userâ€™s performance metrics, such as nutrition products for users seeking to improve their stamina and training programs for those aiming to enhance their performance. Our goal is not to drown the app under an enormous number of add on every page. They will be centralized only on the screen describing a particular activity to keep them relevant.

To cater to users who prefer an ad-free experience, we will offer a subscription model. Subscribers will enjoy an uninterrupted experience with no advertisements, and advanced performance tracking analytics with personalized insights. They will also benefit from priority support with faster response times and dedicated assistance for any issues or queries. The subscription plans will include a monthly plan at 4.99.-  and an annual plan at 49.99.-, offering a 17% discount compared to the monthly plan. To encourage users to experience the benefits of the premium subscription, we will offer a 7-day free trial. In-app prompts will be used to encourage users to upgrade based on their app usage and engagement.

In addition to targeted advertisements and subscription fees, our app will introduce a new system where certain activities, such as complex hikes, will be linked to professional alpine guide services. Users will have the option to book a guide directly through the app, ensuring they receive expert assistance for their adventurous endeavors. This feature not only enhances user safety and experience but also adds a valuable service to our platform. For each booking made through the app, we will take a 5% commission on the amount paid to the guide, providing an additional revenue stream while supporting the professional guide community.

The integration of targeted advertisements, a subscription model, and the new guide booking system not only diversifies our revenue streams but also aligns with the interests and preferences of our user base. By providing value through relevant ads, premium features, and convenient access to professional services, we aim to enhance user satisfaction and drive sustained growth.
