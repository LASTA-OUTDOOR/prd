# Business Model


## Expected operating cost
Most of the backend of the application is managed via services proposed by [Google's Firebase][1] and various Google Cloud APIs which operates under a "Pay as you go" pricing model. During the developpment period, the free solution was enough to test and developp our features, but will be way too restrictive for hundreds or thousands of active users.

 The app is also using two other APIs for [weather predictions][2] and [location auto-completion][2] that offer free plans for small scale business, but might not be enough for a thriving application.

## Revenue Streams

Our app will generate revenue through tree primary channels: targeted advertisements, optional subscription fees and commision on guided activities.

The targeted advertisement system will display relevant ads based on the type of activities users are interested in. This ensures that users receive ads that are beneficial and related to their sporting activities, enhancing their overall experience while providing a significant revenue stream for the app. For example, users looking for bicycle trails will see ads for bicycle tires, maintenance services, cycling gear, and local bike shops on the details page of the activiy. Similarly, users interested in hiking events will see ads for hiking shoes, fitness trackers, sports apparel, and local alpin / hike clubs. Additionally, the ads will be geo-targeted to show local services and products, enhancing relevance and increasing the likelihood of user engagement. This includes ads for nearby gyms, fitness centers, and sports stores, as well as promotions for local sporting events and competitions. Performance-based ads will also be incorporated, relating to the userâ€™s performance metrics, such as nutrition products for users seeking to improve their stamina and training programs for those aiming to enhance their performance. Various ad formats will be utilized to maximize engagement, including banner ads displayed on the main activity feed and during activity tracking, short video ads that users can view for additional app benefits, and sponsored content from advertisers providing value to users through training tips, product reviews, and event announcements.

To cater to users who prefer an ad-free experience, we will offer a subscription model with additional premium features. Subscribers will enjoy an uninterrupted experience with no advertisements, access to premium content such as advanced training programs, exclusive events, and expert tips, and advanced performance tracking analytics with personalized insights. They will also benefit from priority support with faster response times and dedicated assistance for any issues or queries. The subscription plans will include a monthly plan at $4.99 per month and an annual plan at $49.99 per year, offering a 17% discount compared to the monthly plan. To encourage users to experience the benefits of the premium subscription, we will offer a 7-day free trial. In-app prompts will be used to encourage users to upgrade based on their app usage and engagement, and regular promotional campaigns will be conducted during major sporting events and seasons.

The integration of targeted advertisements and a subscription model not only diversifies our revenue streams but also aligns with the interests and preferences of our user base. By providing value through relevant ads and premium features, we aim to enhance user satisfaction and drive sustained growth.
